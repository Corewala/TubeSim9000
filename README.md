# TubeSim9000
It simulates tubes (simulator not included)

Press `left arrow` to close the valve, `right arrow` to open it, and `space` to record the beautiful sounds.

To use your simulator, just throw it into `simulation_thread` and make sure it assigns the correct values to `self.x` and `self.u`
